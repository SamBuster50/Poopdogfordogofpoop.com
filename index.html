        Why are you here? I mean like, why would you type poopdog.html? What's the point?<br>
        I'm not saying you should leave, I just mean there are things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com">youtube</a>  
        ,<br>not that you should click that youtube hyperlink...; I mean.. (Please don't click it, it won't open a new tab it'll just replace this URL)<br>
        Yeah.... but as I was saying, there are things like weeeeeeeeell I guess poopdog. Btw click on ""Hello"". It's a hyperlink with a store where you can buy rubik's cubes.<br>
        I have a lot, like the pyraminx and the 5x5, the Moyu RS3M 2022 (MagLev). Most likely you don't know what I'm talking about,<br>
        Okay sooooooo, still, Why are you here? I mean this is a list of things you could do: TikTok, Instagram, <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, just to name a few<br>
        Still. Why would you type in sambuster50.github.io? But just click on one of the things from the list.<br>
	Also, you should learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube, it's actually very simple. Just go on YouTube,<br>
	and search "Sambuster50 Cubing", then watch my tutorial on how to solve a Rubik's Cube, then subscribe!<br>
